# E-commerce-Shopping-site
This repository contains a front end project which is an E-commerce shopping site.
The website contains the following features:-
1. Main Page- Contains links to all the other pages of project and all the features.
2. Light Slider- built using Jquery, the light slider is highlighted at the start of our main page.
3. Login Page- The login page doesn't opens up on a seperate page but using fade effect opens on the same main page. The page contains validations on input fields and also contains a sign up page within. 
4. Search bar
5. The individual product items contain an add to cart option which increments our products in cart. And they are all linked to the payment gateway of our website. Details of the products pop up on hover. 
6. Exclusive footwear- This page is a special one made for purchasing shoes. Contains- a different slider, review box, rating system, a buy and an add to cart option.
7. The Add to Cart page is still under work and can be improved further. Any suggestions would be strongly welcomed.

This project was built up by a team of four members and each one had a particular contribution respectively.
